## Data and File Description

The data can be classified as a vector dataset, containing geographic points of high peaks in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, located in the southeastern United States of America.  
The data describes height of mountains and knobs measured with LIDAR or survey-grade GPS.  
The data describes 200 geographic points with 53 elements per point. However, some of these elements are left blank.  
The dataset is saved in a Comma Separated Value format and can be accessed through many program applications including Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.  


## Usage
The points described in the dataset can be mapped and inspected visually, using a variety of geospatial analysis tools.

## License
Because this dataset classifies as a U.S. government creative work and is publicly available, it is not subject to copyright restrictions.  
As the work is not restricted, users may reproduce the work in print or digital form, create derivative works, and distribute copies freely.  


## Reproducibility
This data may be very difficult to reproduce due to the high costs of equipment associated with geospatial data collection, high level of required technical expertise, and specific data standards used by the National Park Service when collecting data.  
Due to these combined factors, it may be impractical for an independent researcher to replicate these results.
